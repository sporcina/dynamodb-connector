Welcome
=======
The "DynamoDB Mule Connector" is a wrapper around the AWS Java libraries allowing Mule flows to perform CRUD operations
against AWS DynamoDB tables.  This wrapper allows you to easily interact with AWS tables through Mule.  You can also
leverage the connector directly through Java if you desire.


Setup
=====

To run the tests create the file "AwsCredentials.properties" in your test resources folder
(e.g. /src/test/resources/AwsCredentials.properties).  Place the following content in the file, adding your
AWS access and security keys:


        # Fill in your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
        # http://aws.amazon.com/security-credentials

        accessKey = <insert your key here>
        secretKey = <insert your key here>

If you do not know your keys, you can go here for more information:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSecurityCredentials/1.0/AboutAWSCredentials.html#AccessKeys

Building
========
1. Download the code and navigate to the root folder that houses the pom.xml file.
2. Enter "mvn clean install".

The project will build and execute the acceptance tests automatically.


Running Tests Independently
===========================
Windows Command Prompt or Mac Terminal
Execute "mvn integration-test‚Äù in the root folder of the project.

Within your IDE
Execute "JBehaveStories.java".  For example in IntelliJ you can right-click on the file and run or debug it:
